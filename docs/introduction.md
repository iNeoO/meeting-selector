# Introduction

**Meeting Selector** is a lightweight, fast, and fully customizable Vue component for selecting appointments.

Inspired by the [Doctolib UI](https://www.doctolib.fr/medecin-generaliste/paris), it helps users pick a time slot from a list of available meetings grouped by day. The component includes built-in support for loading states, pagination, and more â€” making it ideal for scheduling workflows in modern web applications.

It comes with **no CSS framework or design system dependency**, giving you full control over the styles and seamless integration with your existing UI.
